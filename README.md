# Face-Detection---Next-Gen-Face-Authentication-for-Servers
This project implements an AI-driven facial recognition system for secure server login using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm. The system captures real-time video to detect and recognize faces, granting or denying access based on face match confidence. If the confidence score is above 80%, the user gains access to the server; otherwise, access is denied. It integrates with AWS EC2 and Lambda for seamless automation and cloud-based authentication. This project enhances security by ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the server.
